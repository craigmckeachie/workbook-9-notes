# Spring Summary

- Spring is powerful, flexible—but heavy to configure
- Spring Boot is Spring configured
- Spring's purpose is to create objects for you
- Spring = Flexibility (loose coupling)
- Beans = Objects
- Inject = @Autowire = give me an object you created for me
- @_______ = annotation
- @Component = A class that Spring should create for you
- IoC = high-level concept (“don’t control object creation yourself”)
- DI = concrete pattern (“inject the objects instead of creating them”)
- Maven Dependency - give me this toolbox
- Spring Dependency - give my this specific tool from the toolbox
